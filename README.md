# TinyFlap

TinyFlap is a Flappy Bird inspired game designed for the Lilygo T-QT development board with a 128x128 TFT display. 

The game uses the following libraries:

- `TFT_eSPI.h` - A library for driving TFT displays using the ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller.
- `Ticker.h` - A library for scheduling periodic tasks in real-time.
- `Preferences.h` - A library for storing and retrieving persistent data in flash memory.

The game has three difficulty levels to choose from, making it suitable for players of all skill levels. The goal of the game is to guide a small bird through a series of pipes by clicking a button. Players must avoid colliding with the pipes while collecting points for successfully passing through them.

If you're looking for a fun and challenging game to play on your Lilygo T-QT development board, give TinyFlap a try!
